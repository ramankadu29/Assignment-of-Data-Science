    "Auditors at a small community bank randomly sample 100 withdrawal transactions made during the week at an ATM machine located near the bankâ€™s main branch. Over the past 2 years, the average withdrawal amount has been 50 USD with a standard deviation of 40 USD. Since audit investigations are typically expensive, the auditors decide to not initiate further investigations if the mean transaction amount of the sample is between 45 USD and 55 USD. What is the probability that in any given week, there will be an investigation?"
